  Weâ€™re always looking for interesting data to explore with Mapbox tools, so when we found this cool dataset of 311 incident reports from NYC Open Data we had to check it out. In the map below, built with Mapbox GL JS and Turf.js, you can explore restaurant disturbance complaints in New York City from 2015. We visualized all 38,400 restaurant-related incidents using 3D hexbins. Click on a hexbin to drill down to details for each complaint.

Using the filters and drill-downs on the dashboard, you can tell that noise from bars and restaurants makes up more than half of all complaints. Would you want to open a business or rent an apartment near the loudest blocks?</p>
